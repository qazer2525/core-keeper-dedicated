## How to run

### ARM based configuration

This image currently includes the following Box64 build variants for the following devices:

- Generic [generic]
- Raspberry Pi 3 [rpi3]
- Raspberry Pi 4 [rpi4-pre3]
- Raspberry Pi 5 (4K page size) [rpi5]
- Raspberry Pi 5 (16K page size) [rpi5_16k]
- M1 (M-Series) Mac [m1]
- ADLink Ampere Altra (Oracle ARM CPUs) [adlink]

By default it is set to use `generic`. If you want to use another one, change the enviromental variable `ARM64_DEVICE` at the `core.env` file.

### Volumes

Create two directories where you want to run your server :

- `server-data`: mandatory if you want to keep configuration between each restart
- `server-files`: optional, contains all the files of the application

### Using Docker CLI:

`docker run -d -e WORLD_NAME="Core Keeper Server" -e MAX_PLAYERS=5 -p 27015:27015/udp -v $(pwd)/server-data:/home/steam/core-keeper-data --name core-keeper-dedicated escaping/core-keeper-dedicated`

### Using Docker Compose
Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yml
services:
  core-keeper:
    container_name: core-keeper-dedicated
    image: escaping/core-keeper-dedicated
    ports:
      - "$SERVER_PORT:$SERVER_PORT/udp"
    volumes:
      - server-files:/home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
      - server-data:/home/steam/core-keeper-data
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - path: override.env
        required: false
    stop_grace_period: 2m
volumes:
    server-files:
    server-data:
```

Create a `override.env` file and override the desired enviromental variables for the dedicated server, see configuration for reference. Example:
```env
ARM64_DEVICE=rpi5
MAX_PLAYERS=3
```

On the folder which contains the files run `docker-compose up -d`.

A `GameID.txt` file will be created next to the executable containing the Game ID. If it doesn't appear you can check the log in the same location named `core-keeper-dedicated/CoreKeeperServerLog.txt` for errors.

To query the game ID run:
`docker exec -it core-keeper-dedicated cat core-keeper-dedicated/GameID.txt`
