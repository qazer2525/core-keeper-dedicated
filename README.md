## How to run

### ARM based configuration

This image currently includes the following Box64 build variants for the following devices:

- Generic [generic]
- Raspberry Pi 5 [rpi5]
- M1 (M-Series) Mac [m1]
- ADLink Ampere Altra (Oracle ARM CPUs) [adlink]

By default it is set to use `generic`. If you want to use another one, change the enviromental variable `ARM64_DEVICE` at the `core.env` file.

### Volumes

Create two directories where you want to run your server :

- `server-data`: mandatory if you want to keep configuration between each restart
- `server-files`: optional, contains all the files of the application

### Using Docker CLI:

`docker run -d -e WORLD_NAME="Core Keeper Server" -e MAX_PLAYERS=5 -v $(pwd)/server-data:/home/steam/core-keeper-data --name core-keeper-dedicated escaping/core-keeper-dedicated`

### Using Docker Compose
Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yml
services:
  core-keeper:
    container_name: core-keeper-dedicated
    image: escaping/core-keeper-dedicated
    volumes:
      - server-files:/home/steam/core-keeper-dedicated
      - server-data:/home/steam/core-keeper-data
    env_file:
      - ./core.env
    restart: always
    stop_grace_period: 2m
volumes:
    server-files:
    server-data:
```

Create a `core.env` file, it should contain the environment variables for the dedicated server, see configuration for reference. Example:
```env
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
ARM64_DEVICE=generic
USE_DEPOT_DOWNLOADER=false
WORLD_INDEX=0
WORLD_NAME="Core Keeper Server"
WORLD_SEED=0
WORLD_MODE=0
GAME_ID=""
DATA_PATH="${STEAMAPPDATADIR}"
MAX_PLAYERS=10
SEASON=""
SERVER_IP=""
SERVER_PORT=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
# Player Join
DISCORD_PLAYER_JOIN_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_PLAYER_JOIN_MESSAGE="$${char_name} ($${steamid}) has joined the server."
DISCORD_PLAYER_JOIN_TITLE="Player Joined"
DISCORD_PLAYER_JOIN_COLOR="47456"
# Player Leave
DISCORD_PLAYER_LEAVE_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_PLAYER_LEAVE_MESSAGE="$${char_name} ($${steamid}) has disconnected. Reason: $${reason}."
DISCORD_PLAYER_LEAVE_TITLE="Player Left"
DISCORD_PLAYER_LEAVE_COLOR="11477760"
# Server Start
DISCORD_SERVER_START_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_SERVER_START_MESSAGE="**World:** $${world_name}\n**GameID:** $${gameid}"
DISCORD_SERVER_START_TITLE="Server Started"
DISCORD_SERVER_START_COLOR="2013440"
# Server Stop
DISCORD_SERVER_STOP_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_SERVER_STOP_MESSAGE=""
DISCORD_SERVER_STOP_TITLE="Server Stopped"
DISCORD_SERVER_STOP_COLOR="12779520"
```

On the folder which contains the files run `docker-compose up -d`.

A `GameID.txt` file will be created next to the executable containing the Game ID. If it doesn't appear you can check the log in the same location named `core-keeper-dedicated/CoreKeeperServerLog.txt` for errors.

To query the game ID run:
`docker exec -it core-keeper-dedicated cat core-keeper-dedicated/GameID.txt`
